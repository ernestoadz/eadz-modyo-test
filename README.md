The project was developed with Vue 3 and the Nuxt Framework to take advantage of its compilation with vite, performance and other features.

As one of the requirements of the project was performance, I developed the project being SSR with Nuxt for fast loading and used the Tailwind classes to not overload the extra css code.

System requeriments:

- Node v20.x (I specifically used node v20.4.0)

To run project:

npm install

npm run dev
